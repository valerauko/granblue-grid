# GBF Grid Show

A convenient and hopefully safe Chrome extension that displays your active Granblue Fantasy grid (team, summons, skills, weapons), so you don't have to manually screenshot them all the time if you want to show it off in some video.

## Levels and weapon skills don't show up?

Certain details about the grid aren't available when starting a quest or joining a raid. If you want to display more details, you'll have to open the Party (編成) page with the extension active.

## Is this safe to use?

It doesn't send any requests, doesn't use any resources not already available in the game, nor display any information that isn't readily available in-game. The purpose is just that streamers don't have to redo a bunch of screenshots every time they update their grid (which can happen quite often).

That said, GBF is famously strict about "tool use" so use only at your own risk.
